Given an array of n elements such that every element of array is an integer in the range 1 to n, find the sum of all
the distinct elements of the array.

Input:
First line consists of T test cases. First line of every test case consists of N. Second line of every test case consists 
of elements of Array.

Output:
Single line output, print the sum of distinct element of array.

Constraints:
1<=T<=200
1<=N<=10^4

Example:
Input:
2
5
1 2 3 3 4
5
1 1 1 2 2
Output:
10
3
