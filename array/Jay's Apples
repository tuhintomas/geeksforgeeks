One day Jay, on getting his first salary, decides to distribute apples among the poverty-stricken persons. He gave each person 1kg 
of apples. People are coming in a queue and he makes sure that he gives every person 1 kg of apples only once. Every person is 
identified by a specific integer.

Given the length of the queue N followed by an array of N integers, denoting the persons in that queue, find the minimum kg's of
apples Jay will have to distribute.

Input:
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. For each test case there will be two test lines.
The first line contains the length of queue N. The second line contains the N space seperated integers which denotes the people in the
queue.

Output:
For each test case, output a single line containing the answer.

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 20
1 ≤ N ≤ 105
1 ≤ Ai ≤ 105

Example:
Input:
2 
5 
1 1 1 1 1 
5 
1 2 3 1 2

Output:
1
3

Explanation:

For test case 1, the same person (identified by the integer '1' comes again and again in the queue, but Jay will not give him apples 
again and again . He gave him apples only once so minimum kg's of apples here required-1kg).
For test case 2, person '1' comes and takes 1kg of apples,then person '2' comes and takes 1kg of apples from Jay and then person '3' 
comes and he also takes 1kg of apples from Jay, then person '1' again comes but he gets nothing as he has already been awarded apples 
and so with person '2'.So, minimum kg's of apples require 3kg.
