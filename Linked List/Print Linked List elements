You are given the pointer to the head node of a linked list. You have to print all of its elements in order in a single line.

Input:
You have to complete a method which takes one argument: the head of the linked list. You should not read any input from stdin/console.
The struct Node has a data part which stores the data and a next pointer which points to the next element
of the linked list. There are multiple test cases. For each test case, this method will be called individually.

Output:
Print the elements of the linked list in a single line separated by a single space.

User Task:
The task is to complete the function display() which prints the elements of the linked list.

Example:
Input:
2
2
1 2
1
4

Output:
1 2
4

Explanation:
Testcase 1: Here the first line denotes an integer 'T' the no of test cases and the next line denotes 'N' the no of nodes
of linked list . Then the line after that contains N space separated integers denoting the values of the nodes of the linked list.






def printlist(node):
    if node==None:
        return
    cur=node
    while cur!=None:
        print(cur.data,end=" ")
        cur=cur.next
