You are given an array of 0s and 1s in random order. Modify the array to segregate 0s on left side and 1s on right side of the array.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. For each test there will be two lines. 
The first line contains the size of the array N. The second line contains the N space seperated elements of the array.

Output:
Print the modified array.

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 107
0 ≤ Ai ≤ 1

Example:
Input:
2
5
0 0 1 1 0
4
1 1 1 1

Output:
0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1

Explanation:
Testcase 1: All 0s are segregated to left and all 1s to right of the array. So, the modified array is 0 0 0 1 1.





def segregate_01(arr):
    index=0
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i]==0:
            arr[i],arr[index]=arr[index],arr[i]
            index+=1
    return arr
t=int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n=int(input())
    arr=[int(x) for x in input().split()]
    print(" ".join(map(str,segregate_01(arr))))
